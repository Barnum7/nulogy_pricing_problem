"Job Class Instance Method"

- Class Job with each instance having 3 paramaters (base price, people, materials)

- This first parameter will immediately be multiplied by 1.05 for the 5% flat markup. This will be saved in a variable called "starting_price"

-The people paramater will be multipled by .012. The value returned from this multiplication will be saved in a variable called "people_markup"

-This parameter will be fed into a case statement. WHEN pharmaceuticals return .075 etc. This value will be saved in a variable called "materials_markup"

-Sum "people_markup" and "materials_markup" + 1 and this variable will be called "other_markups" (the + 1 is because I don't know how to create 1."variable". Will come back to)

-final_price = starting_price * other_markups
return final_price 

"Command Line Application Method"

- The calculator needs to be able to bring in a base price input.

- This first input will immediately be multiplied by 1.05 for the 5% flat markup. This will be saved in a variable called "starting_price"

-The next input will be the number of people. The number of people will be multipled by .012. The value returned from this multiplication will be saved in a variable called "people_markup"

-The third, and final, input will be what materials are involved. This input will be fed into a case statement. WHEN pharmaceuticals return .075 etc. This value will be saved in a variable called "materials_markup"

-Sum "people_markup" and "materials_markup" + 1 and this variable will be called "other_markups" (the + 1 is because I don't know how to create 1."variable". Will come back to)

-final_price = starting_price * other_markups
return final_price
